# virtual-agent-gesture

These are scripts I ran to control my virtual agent. The virtual agent gave directions in 6 different spatial directions from a starting point: right, left, right up, left up, right behind, and left behind. Three different versions agent were programmed for each direction: g1 (no gesture), g2 (head and body gestures), and g3 (head, body, and arm gestures).
